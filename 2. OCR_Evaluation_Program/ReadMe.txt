OCR_Evaluation Program:

Working:
It uses OCR_Text of Ground Truth Document Image and Calculates the Quality Score(QS) of the input test Image.
(Note: 1 Ground_Truth OCR_Text has been used to compute QS of 4 image belonging to same set)


Eg): If we have OCR_Text of Original Image: 1.png 
     Then, QS of Images: 1_1.png, 1_2.png, 1_3.png and 1_4.png , can be calculated.

Note: All the 80 Images have been already been preprocessed and respective quality score have been updated in SOC_gt.xlsx file.
