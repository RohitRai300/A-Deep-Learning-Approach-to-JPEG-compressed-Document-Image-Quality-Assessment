Mtech (Jan-May21) Semester Project

Project Title: 
### A Deep Learning Approach to JPEG Compressed Document Image Quality Assessment.

#### Description of Directories: 

1) **Document_Images_Complete** :| https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Tyn_90fJpGlH5zFOm_N5vQCJngIut_ZD?usp=sharing | {Google Drive Link of Dataset}

2) **OCR_Evaluation_Program**   : This program is used to generate Groud Truth Quality Scores of the Document Images.

3) **Document_Img_Preprocessing**: This contains code for image Preprocessing.

4) **Data_for_Model_Building**  : This Contains the Final set of images which is used for model training and testing resulting form combined effort of previous stages. 

5) **JPEG_Compr_DIQA_CNN_Model** : It contains complete developed CNN model which is used for estimating Quality Score of the input test document Image.    

6) **Screenshots and Analysis**  : It contains Images(working demo, preprocessing output, etc.)
